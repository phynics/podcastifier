# Podcastifier

This tool fetches videos feeds from online sources and transpiles those to audio to be consumed as podcasts.

## Possible Improvements

- Adapters should be imported from the configuration file.

- Transpiler design should be rework to reduce coupling.

- App should register and handle push updates.

- FeedGenerator and FeedTranspiler are old code. They should be refactored to reduce coupling.

- Express should keep simple statistics.
